						<b>INGREDIENTS</b> <br> <br>
5g fresh yeast<br>
135ml/4 3/4 fl oz cold water<br>
100g/3 1/2 oz strong white bread flour, preferably organic<br>
100g/3 1/2 oz rye flour<br>
680ml/1 pint 4 1/2 fl oz tap water<br>
940g/2lb 1 1/4 oz traditional white bread flour, preferably organic, plus extra for<br> dusting
130g/4 1/2 oz dark rye flour<br>
15g/ 1/2 oz fine sea salt<br>
22g/3/4 oz fresh yeast<br>
For the beer roll topping<br>
10g/1/ 2 oz fresh yeast, crumbled<br>
140ml/5fl oz beer (ale)<br>
110g/4oz rye flour </div>
					<div id="directions-content">
						<b>DIRECTIONS</b> <br> <br>
					1. For the dough starter, whisk the yeast into the water until dissolved.

2. Mix the white and dark rye flours in a separate bowl until well combined.<br>
3. Pour the yeast mixture over the flours, whisking well to form a thick paste. Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel and set aside to ferment for at least 6 hours and up to 18 hours at room temperature. You can use dried yeast but you will only need half the quantity. Yeast is dormant at 4C, active between 20-40C and destroyed at 45-50 C. Using a dough starter in bread making gives a greater complexity of flavour; as the yeast activates and feeds on the natural sugars present in the flour, over time it produces a distinctively tangy or sour taste.<br>
4. For the dough, line two large baking trays with baking parchment.<br>
5. Add the water to the fermented dough starter and mix well to combine.</div>

						<b>INGREDIENTS</b> <br> <br>


    5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br>
    2 large yellow onions, coarsely chopped<br>
    2 tablespoons tomato paste<br>
    1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper<br>
    1/2 cup pitted kalamata olives, quartered<br>
    1/2 cup cherry or grape tomatoes, quartered<br>
    Salt<br>
    Pepper<br>
    Three 1/4-ounce packages active dry yeast<br>
    1 teaspoon sugar<br>
    1 3/4 cups warm water<br>
    2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for shaping<br>
    3/4 cup fine semolina<br>

</div>
					<div id="directions-content">
						<b>DIRECTIONS</b> <br> <br>


    1. In a large skillet, heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil. Add the onions and cook over moderately high heat until lightly caramelized, 8 minutes. Add the tomato paste and crushed red pepper and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in the olives and tomatoes. Season with salt and black pepper and let cool.
    <br> 2. In a bowl, whisk the yeast, sugar and water; let stand until foamy, 10 minutes. Whisk in the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and 1 teaspoon of salt. Stir in the 2 1/2 cups of flour and the semolina until the dough comes together; it will be quite wet. Stir in the cooled olive mixture. Cover the dough with a damp kitchen towel. Let stand in a warm spot until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.
    <br> 3. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Scrape the dough out onto a well-floured work surface. Shape it into 2 rough 14-by-3 1/2-inch loaves and transfer to a parchment paperâ€“lined baking sheet. Bake for 25 minutes, until the loaves are lightly browned and risen; transfer to a rack and let cool completely.

					<div id="ingredients-content">
						<b>INGREDIENTS</b> <br> <br>
4 large Golden Delicious apples (about 3 pounds)<br>
1/4 cup sugar<br>
1 lemon, juiced<br>
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br>
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br>
1 cup walnuts or pecans, roughly chopped<br>

					<div id="directions-content">
						<b>DIRECTIONS</b> <br> <br>
					
Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.

Peel, core, and slice apples into 1/4-inch slices. Place apples in a large mixing bowl and toss with sugar, lemon juice, flour, and cinnamon. Pour into a lightly greased 9 by 13-inch baking dish, and spread out into an even layer. Set aside.

In another large bowl, mix together the nuts, flour, oats, sugar, cinnamon, and salt for the topping. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, gently work in the cold butter until pea-sized lumps are formed.

						<b>DIRECTIONS</b> <br> <br>
					Cut dough in half and chill 1 half, wrapped in plastic wrap. Roll out other half on a lightly floured surface, dusting with flour as necessary and stretching corners to maintain shape, into a 16- by 12-inch rectangle. Brush off excess flour with pastry brush and trim edges with a pizza wheel or sharp knife.<br>

Arrange dough with a short side nearest you. Cut in half horizontally and chill 1 half. Cut remaining half vertically into thirds, forming 3 rectangles. Cut each rectangle diagonally in half to make 2 triangles, for a total of 6 triangles.<br>

Shape croissants:
Holding short side (side opposite tip) of 1 triangle in one hand, stretch dough, tugging and sliding with other hand toward tip to elongate by about 50 percent.<br>

Return to work surface with short side of triangle nearest you. Beginning with short side, roll up triangle toward tip. Croissant should overlap 3 times, with tip sticking out from underneath; you may need to stretch dough while rolling.)<br>

1/2 cup Dutch-processed cocoa<br>
3/4 cup all-purpose Gold Medal flour<br>
1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br>
3/4 teaspoon baking powder<br>
2 large eggs, at room temperature<br>
3/4 cup granulated sugar<br>

2 cups powdered sugar<br>
1 cup fresh raspberries<br>
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br>
Additional fresh raspberries, for garnish-if desired<br>



 </div>
					<div id="directions-content">
						<b>DIRECTIONS</b> <br> <br>
					1.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

2. Place butter, chocolate and cocoa powder in a heatproof bowl. Microwave in 30 second spurts on 50% power, stirring in between, until the butter and chocolate are melted and the mixture is smooth. <br>

3. Whisk together the flour, baking soda, and baking powder. Whisk the eggs in a bowl to combine, then add the sugar, vanilla and salt and continue whisking. Add the cooled chocolate mixture to the bowl and whisk to combine. Sift one-third of the flour mixture into the bowl and whisk gently to combine. Add the Greek yogurt or sour cream and whisk to combine. Sift the the rest of the flour mixture into the bowl and whisk until everything is well combined. <br>

4. Divide the batter evenly among the muffin tins. Bake about 18-20 minutes. Remove the pan to a wire rack and let the cupcakes cool for a few minutes before removing them to the rack to cool completely.<br>

5. In a food processor or blender, puree the raspberries. Pour raspberries through a fine sieve into a bowl, pressing on solids, to eliminate the seeds. Place butter, half of the powdered sugar, and raspberry puree into mixing bowl. Beat over low speed until well-blended. Add the other half of the sugar. <br>

Never have bagels been more abundant or elusive: Most bakeries, coffee shops, and corner delis hawk them, but an authentic crackly, chewy bagel is as common as a tasty burrito in Dubuque. Tired of settling for bland impostors, we turned to our own oven.

Traditional bagels are made of high-gluten flour, yeast, water, salt, and malt. Some bagelries substitute sugar, brown sugar, or honey for the malt. In the name of convenience, we started with basic pantry items and then added more esoteric ingredients to build a more bona fide bagel flavor and texture. After baking nearly 100 bagels, we are confident that our recipe produces the best in the West.

What to buy: Malt syrup is a natural sweetener made from a mash of corn and barley that is not quite as sweet as honey and has a slightly earthy note; it adds that distinct maltiness that makes a bagel really taste bagel-y. It can be found in natural food stores or online.
